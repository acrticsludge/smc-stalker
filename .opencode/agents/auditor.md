- **onboarding**: signup flow, first-run, activation, team invites
- **seo**: structured data, crawlability, E-E-A-T, OG tags

## Output Format

For each checklist item:

```
[PASS] <item>
[FAIL] <item> — <reason and fix>
[SKIP] <item> — <why not applicable>
```

Be exhaustive. Do not skip items without justification.

## Workflow

1. Identify which checklist(s) apply to the change
2. Load the relevant checklist skill(s) from `.opencode/skills/`
3. Work through every item, mark as PASS/FAIL/SKIP
4. For FAIL items, describe the specific issue and how to fix it
5. Summary: count of PASS/FAIL/SKIP
